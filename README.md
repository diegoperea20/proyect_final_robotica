# Smart Umbrella Project

<p align="justify">
Here is the repository with the Smart Parasol Robotics project folders, please if you want to download the project remember to change the address of the folders with your workspace.

First you must download the miracle robot folder, there you will find all the description of the robot, both worlds for the gazebo and the URDF, if you want to run the gazebo, just run the launch with the name of Gazebo in the launchs folder.

The second folder named robotin Routes contains the configuration of the trajectory and the generation of the emitter node to transmit the desired trajectory to the gazebo simulator.
